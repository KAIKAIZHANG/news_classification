/root/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as `np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type`.
  from ._conv import register_converters as _register_converters
WARNING:tensorflow:From /root/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/datasets/base.py:198: retry (from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.base) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use the retry module or similar alternatives.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /root/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py:497: calling conv1d (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with data_format=NHWC is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
`NHWC` for data_format is deprecated, use `NWC` instead
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/www/text_classification/text_classification/cnn_model.py:66: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.

See tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2.
